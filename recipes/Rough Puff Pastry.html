    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you love to bake, pastry dough recipes are great ones to return to again and again to try in different ways
        and perfect over time. A rough puff pastry is essentially a no-frills way to make quick dough. There is little
        mixing involved, so the process is fairly easy, but you end up with a buttery, flaky pastry.
        Dough like this is great for hand pies, tarts, or other small baked goods. Add cold cubes of butter and ice cold
        water to your dry ingredients to create the dough. Since there are so few ingredients in this recipe, a good
        butter will really help the flavor. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add butter and toss with
            your fingertips until evenly coated with flour.</li>
        <li>Add water to bowl. Mix on low speed until the dough forms a shaggy mass, about 45 seconds.</li>
        <li> Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until butter is firm but not brittle, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured work surface and roll into a ½-inch-thick rectangle that is about 10 ½ x 6
            inches.</li>
        <li>Fold one third of the longer side of the dough over the center third of dough. Fold the final third over the
            center (like you would fold a letter). Tightly wrap folded dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until
            chilled, about 30 minutes. Repeat this process of rolling, folding and refrigerating 4 more times, turning
            the dough 90 degrees each time before rolling.
        </li>
        <li>After completing the final fold, wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm before
            using, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days..</li>
    </ol>
